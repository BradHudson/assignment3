Ensure you have the following:
1. Python3

Steps to test:
1. Clone the Repository
2. Run `python3 cluster_v2.py` to run the clustering experiments for Question 1.
3. Run `python3 dim_reduce.py` to run the dimensionality experiments for Question 2 & 3.
4. Run `python3 ReducedNN.py` to run the neural network experiments on the reduced data for Question 4.
5. Run `python3 ClusteredNN.py` to run the neural network experiments on the data with cluster labels for Question 5.
